Build stand alone 2d panels for FlightGear using Qt/Qml

Usage:
	quickpanel /path/to/panel/directory

	QuickPanel will look in the panel directory for panel.qml. This is the
    entry point for your panel.

	QuickPanel will also look in the panel directory for protocol.xml. This
    is a FlightGear generic protocol definition to be used for communication
    with FlightGear.

	QuickPanel will parse the protocol file for all properties defined in the
    chunks under the output of the output section of the protocol. These
    will be then made available to your Qml via `quickpanel.getProperty(name)'
    as well as other interfaces (see example panel).

    If your output chunk has a <name> element, that is the name the property
    will be exposed as in QuickPanel, otherwise it will use the <node> element.

	QuickPanel currently listens for incoming packets on port 7000.
